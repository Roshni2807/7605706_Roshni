Moin, moin!Tchuss

You already learnt: this greeting is "Ostfriesisches Platt" and you use
all day!

A nice opportunity to learn a second word from "Ostfriesisches Platt":

"Moi" == good, nice, pleasant.

So maybe "Morgen" means "Tomorrow", but nevertheless you hear it
all day.

(see: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moin)
